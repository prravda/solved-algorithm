# Retrospect for first solution

**Date: 2023-11-08**

I tried to solve [a problem on programmers](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/87390). But I only passed base test cases and didn't pass the whole cases.

I just focused on 'how to solve it' only. Didn't care about the efficiency, the size of input.

The size of input is `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7`. General computing environment for problem solving can handle about `10^9` calculation. But my logic's time complexity is already larger than `O(n^3)` so simply my code exceeded the calculation limit.

Go back and think about the basic again.
